# CTIMS MatchMiner Engine 
Welcome to the documentation for the CTIMS MatchMiner match engine! The engine is a system designed to match cancer patients to genomically driven clinical trials using Clinical Trial Markup Language (CTML) and patient clinical, treatment and genomic data. It utilizes the the MatchminerAPI for returning trial match information.

This version of MatchMiner Engine was developed by UHN in collaboration with DFCI. DFCI has approved the additions and modifications to MatchMiner Engine. This MatchMiner engine is version 3 of MatchMiner as it now supports treatment data along with clinical and genomic data for matching.
